I'm Jigar Chavada - a final year student at Indian Institute Of Information Technology, Allahabad. I was born and brought up in Mumbai where I currently reside as well and have lived in Allahabad (Prayagraj) and Delhi for some while.<br/><br/>
I am an engineer by heart and like to play around with Tech a lot and love to tinkle around all things related to Distributed Systems, Backend & Infrastructure. Conversations around Technical Architectures and brainstorming elegant solutions to difficult problems give me my natural high. I am a very curious person and love to engage in conversations about crafts of other people. <br/><br/>
I am currently working at <a href="https://udaan.com/" target="_blank">Udaan</a> as an Engineering Intern. I have previously interned at <a href="http://inspirit.work/" target="_blank">Inspirit</a>, <a href="https://www.gojek.io/" target="_blank">Gojek</a> and <a href="https://atlan.com/" target="_blank">Atlan</a>. The things which I have learned while interning at each of these places is:
<ol>
  <li>Slope matters more than intercept. It's not where you are today that matters, itâ€™s the curiosity and the willingness to learn and improve over time that matters. Because little slope over time can beat a large intercept today.</li>
  <li>Curiosity has created more opportunities than hard work ever will. Willingness to learn is one of the most important trait a person can have. Many people get stuck because they lose their ability to quickly adapt and learn newer things.</li>
  <li>If you are in your comfort zone, you are not working hard to achieve things you want in live. Nothing good happens to a person who doesn't struggle for it. If you feel it is easy, then you are doing it wrong.</li>
</ol>
