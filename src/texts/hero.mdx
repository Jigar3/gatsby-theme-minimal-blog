I'm Jigar Chavada - a final year student at Indian Institute Of Information Technology, Allahabad. I was born and brought up in Mumbai where I currently reside as well and have lived in Allahabad (Prayagraj) and Delhi for brief periods.
<br/><br/>
I am an engineer by heart and like to play around with Tech a lot and love to tinkle around all things related to Distributed Systems, Backend & Infrastructure. I am a naturally curious person and love to engage in conversations about the crafts of other people. I also consider myself a product person and it gives me pure joy to talk about real problems and finding real solutions through the means of technology. 
<br/><br/>
I am currently working at <a href="https://udaan.com/" target="_blank">Udaan</a> as an Engineering Intern. I have previously interned at <a href="http://inspirit.work/" target="_blank">Inspirit</a>, <a href="https://www.gojek.io/" target="_blank">Gojek</a> and <a href="https://atlan.com/" target="_blank">Atlan</a>.
