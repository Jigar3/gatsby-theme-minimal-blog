  Hi ðŸ‘‹
</Text>

I'm Jigar - a final year student at Indian Institute Of Information Technology, Allahabad. <br/><br/>
I am an engineer by heart and like to play around with Tech a lot and love to tinkle around all things related to Distributed Systems, Backend & Infrastructure. <br/><br/>
I am currently working at <a href="http://inspirit.work/" target="_blank">Inspirit</a> as an Engineering Intern (*It's a small team and my first stint working in a high paced start-upy environment with a lot of responsibility and ownership*). I have previously interned at <a href="https://www.gojek.io/" target="_blank">Gojek</a> and <a href="https://atlan.com/" target="_blank">Atlan</a>
